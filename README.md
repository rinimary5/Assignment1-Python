You are provided with a JSON file named “employee_data.json” containing employee
 records. Each employee record has the following fields: “id,” “name,” “department,” and
 “salary.”
 Your task is to write a Python program that reads this JSON file, performs data
 transformation, and answers the following questions:
 1.Create a new JSON file named “salary_summary.json” that contains the
 average salary for each department.
 2.Find the employee with the highest salary and print their details.
 Sample JSON Data (employee_data.json):
 [
 {
 "id": 1,
 "name": "Aadhil",
 "department": "HR",
 "salary": 60000
 },
 {
 "id": 2,
 "name": "Aaryan",
 "department": "Engineering",
 "salary": 75000
 },
 {
 "id": 3,
 "name": "Navilan",
 "department": "HR",
 "salary": 62000
 },
 {
 "id": 4,
 "name": "Sarvesh",
 "department": "Sales",
 "salary": 58000
 },
{
 }
 "id": 5,
 "name": "Sabari",
 "department": "Engineering",
 "salary": 80000
 ]
 Sample Output:
 1.“salary_summary.json” (Average salary for each department):
 {
 }
 "HR": 61000,
 "Engineering": 77500,
 "Sales": 58000
 2.Employee with the highest salary:
 Name: Sabari
 Department: Engineering
 Salary: 80000
